# check-baseline.sh — does this tree still produce the same simulations as a
# reference revision?
#
# A given config plus seed must produce the same run, byte for byte, and a
# refactor must not move it.  "The tests still pass" is too weak a signal for
# anything touching the kernel clock, the event pump or a mote tick: TSCH can
# still associate and RPL can still form a DAG after a timing shift that has,
# in fact, changed the simulation.
#
# So: build a reference revision, run a set of workloads with both binaries
# *from this working tree* (same configs, same firmware — only the engine
# differs), and diff the output line by line.  Every console line carries a
# simulated timestamp, so identical output means every mote executed at the
# same nanosecond and printed the same bytes.
#
# Its sibling tools/check-determinism.sh answers a different question — is one
# run reproducible? — by running the same simulation twice with one binary.
#
#   tools/check-baseline.sh                 # reference: merge-base with main
#   tools/check-baseline.sh main            # or any ref
#   tools/check-baseline.sh HEAD~3
#   KEEP=1 tools/check-baseline.sh          # keep the logs for inspection
#   TIMING=1 tools/check-baseline.sh        # run the workloads one at a time
#
# Each line also carries both binaries' wall time and the change.  The
# workloads run concurrently by default, so those numbers are contended and
# only indicative (tens of percent): a regression signal to follow up with
# a real measurement, not a benchmark.  TIMING=1 serialises the runs, ref and
# head back to back per workload, for numbers worth quoting, at about one
# workload's worth of time per workload.
# The simulation output is compared the same way either way.
#
# Exit code 0 = identical, 1 = a workload differs, or did not complete under
# this tree's binary (non-zero exit, timeout, no Wall-clock line).
