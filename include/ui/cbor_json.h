/*
 * cbor_json — write one CBOR item as JSON text.
 *
 * The UI recorder (websocket_ui_service.c, --ui-record) stores each CBOR
 * delta the server broadcasts as JSON, so a recording is the exact wire
 * stream in the form the browser's replay player reads.  Map keys become
 * JSON strings ("0".."6", node ids), which is how a decoded CBOR map
 * already behaves in JavaScript.  Byte strings (unused by the UI) are
 * written as hex strings; undefined as null.
 *
 * It reads through lib/cbor's reader, so it accepts exactly what that
 * library's writer produces — the encoding sim_state_delta_cbor uses.
